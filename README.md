Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts which customers are likely to leave a service using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.
It applies machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify churn patterns based on customer demographics, service usage, and account information.

Key steps
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE

Model training, evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)

Saving the best model for future predictions

Tools used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imbalanced-learn
